# Introduction to Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

Within the project directory, you have access to the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the application in development mode.\
To view it in your browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will automatically reload when changes are made.\
Any lint errors will also be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application for production into the `build` folder.\
React is properly bundled in production mode, ensuring optimized performance.

The build output is minified, and filenames include hashes.\
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For further information, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a non-reversible action!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configurations, you can `eject` at any time. This will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, granting full control. All commands except `eject` remain functional but now refer to the copied scripts, allowing customization. From this point forward, you're on your own.

Using `eject` is optional. The provided feature set suits most small to mid-sized deployments. There's no obligation to utilize this feature, but it's available for customization when you're ready.
